# EITF05
Project in the course EITF05 Websecurity (https://www.eit.lth.se/kurs/eitf05)

This project involved designing a minimalistic but secure webshop. I had to first implement and demonstrate three attacks on webshop and then patch it up to make it secure against said attacks. I chose to implement SQL-injections, Cross Site Sqripting (XSS), and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It also involved the use of secure user authentication and secure storage of user credentials, which I learned the theory for in earlier security courses.

I had to use PHP for the first time, which is evident by the code written, if I would write it again it would probably be better.
